title: cadCAD Resources
description: For those diving for the first time into the pool of knowledge about token engineering and complex system modelling, cadCAD stands out as an indispensable resource. cadCAD, which stands for complex adaptive dynamics Computer-Aided Design, is a Python-based framework that aids in the design, simulation, validation, and operation of complex systems. It is particularly tailored for exploring "what if" scenarios, allowing users to simulate the impact of various actions on a system to make informed decisions.

A plethora of resources is available for those looking to master cadCAD. The official [cadCAD website](https://cadcad.org/) offers a comprehensive introduction to the tool, detailing its use cases, such as accounting for model uncertainties using Monte Carlo methods, exploring different agent behaviours with A/B testing, and fine-tuning systems through parameter sweeping simulations.

For hands-on learning, YouTube hosts a series of [cadCAD Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmWm8ksQq4YKtdRV-SoinhV6LbQMgX1we) that introduce basic concepts of cadCAD and system modelling using simple models. These tutorials are an excellent starting point for beginners.

GitHub is another valuable resource, with repositories like [cadCAD's official repository](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD) and [cadCAD Edu](https://www.cadcad.education/), which offers a beginner course for those new to cadCAD, providing a structured learning path.

Another noteworthy GitHub repository is [BlockScience's cadCAD-Tutorials](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD-Tutorials), which offers tutorials and demos for learning how to use cadCAD effectively, focusing on designing, testing, and validating complex systems through simulation in Python.

For detailed documentation and a crash course on cadCAD, the [cadCAD documentation](https://cadcad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) on Read the Docs is an invaluable resource. It covers installation, a crash course, and an in-depth exploration of cadCAD's API, along with additional resources for further learning.

These resources cater to various learning styles and needs. Whether you prefer video tutorials, hands-on projects, or comprehensive documentation, there's something available to enhance your understanding and application of cadCAD in your projects.
