## List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them

The goal of the Cardano Open: Ecosystem (non-technical) category is to drive ecosystem growth, foster education and community initiatives, expand Cardanoâ€™s global footprint and onboard more Cardano users. The relevant areas of interest which this project contributed towards:

- Content and education creation/curation
- Informative and insightful content in the form of videos, blogs, and graphic designs
- Education advancement
- Knowledge bases and documentation
- Course materials & tutorials
- Translations

**Drive ecosystem growth and adoption:** This project contributed to ecosystem growth by providing free educational resources on token engineering with a focus on the eUTXO model and Cardano. By increasing awareness and knowledge of token engineering principles, product owners and developers can apply them to build more robust, equitable and inclusive tools and hence attract more users and value to the Cardano ecosystem.

**Foster education and community initiatives:** By delivering a 5-part tutorial series on Token Engineering on Cardano; specifically, how to design economic mechanisms. Tutorial videos and documentation are available via our website, [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@tokenflows) and [Github](https://github.com/tokenflows). This series offers an introduction to token engineering principles, helping individuals apply it to their projects. All content is freely accessible to build community, collaboration and active knowledge sharing.

**Expand Cardano's global footprint:** By providing Japanese translations of all documentation and video subtitles, the educational resources are freely accessible to English and Japanese audiences around the world.

**Onboard more Cardano users:** This project helps product managers and developers understand key concepts for building dApps, indirectly onboarding users interested in both the technical aspects and economic value creation within the ecosystem. The tutorials bring these topics into introductory-level modules, with the intent to make the concepts more accessible, lowering the entry barrier for newcomers and encouraging broader participation.

## List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them

**Content Creation:** To produce an introductory video and a concise five-module tutorial series on token engineering.

- **How the project addressed it:** All project outputs completed and published to aforementioned channels.

**Reach and Engagement:** To reach at least 300 community members within the first year of the content being released.

- Aiming to reach at least 300 community members within the first year of release. Active promotion through X and town halls is planned in the coming months.

**Knowledge Application:** To see an increase in the application of token engineering in the design and development of projects within the Cardano ecosystem (quantitative) and by observing the discourse in the community (qualitative).

- Observed a small growing interest in token engineering within Cardano, evidenced by initiatives like the [Cardano Token Engineering Lab](https://thetokenlab.xyz/) and our ongoing [Tokenflows website](https://tokenflows.xyz/). Additionally, an increased application of token engineering principles in Catalyst proposals. For example: [Iceberg: Just the tip of Cardano Onchain Analytics](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/132034) and [Cardano Resilience Index](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/131989).

**Foster Collaboration and Growth:** To promote a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing within the Cardano community.

- Will be measured by the quality and quantity of user contributions, feedback, and discussions around the project content after its promotion.

## Key achievements

- Successfully delivered a high-quality 5-part tutorial series on Token Engineering on Cardano.
- Achieved full translation of all documentation into Japanese, including subtitles for videos.
- Made all content freely accessible to the public through our project website, Github repository, and YouTube channel.
- Continually fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within the Cardano community at Town-halls and through social media.

## Key learnings

Learning to use various tools and set up workflows for creating and publishing content was labour intensive. As was thoroughly researching many different topics and creating visual content. We did not include code example or live demonstrations, since we focused on theoretical content and graphic design instead. This will be part of our next steps.

As a result of completing this project, a deeper understanding of token engineering was gained by teaching it to others. Learning how to create and publish textual, visual and video content may also prove useful for ease and efficiency in creating future content.

## Next steps for the product or service developed

- Actively promote tutorial series and engage with the community to spread awareness and develop further interest in applying token engineering to Cardano projects.
- Translate tutorial series into furthermore languages. We already have some content translated into Vietnamese.
- Continue building a hub for eUTXO token engineering practice on Tokenflows.
- Live cadCAD demonstrations with code examples.

## Final thoughts/comments

This tutorial series aims to be an overview of high-level concepts and an open-source repository for people to refer back to and explore concepts more deeply. It represents an extension in the future development of Cardano and other token based projects. By enabling people with the basic token engineering skills, we're contributing to a more robust and equitable ecosystem. We're excited to see how the long-term impact of this project plays out as more people use these resources to build decentralised applications on Cardano.
