title: What is Token Engineering?
description: Token Engineering is an emerging field that combines elements of economics, computer science, and systems engineering to design and analyse blockchain-based tokens. The primary focus in Token Engineering is on creating tokens that are secure, efficient, and equitable, ensuring they align with the overall system goals.

Token engineering is a vast field but essentially, it boils down to designing better incentives and disincentives such that we create win-wins. A win-win is an action that benefits the individual as well as the system. A simple example of this is driving - you are incentivised to drive on your side of the road and disincentivised to drive on the other side as that would result in an accident. This benefits you but also other drivers sharing the road. Similarly, in the digital world, we want to create incentives/disincentives that naturally make people behave in this manner. Doing so allows us to design robust token economies which create efficient and effective coordination between people within a system.

TE academy have done fantastic work to establish the emerging discipline of token engineering. They have created a five module educational course called TE Fundamentals. This is centred predominantly around the Ethereum based accounting model. The aim of TokenFlows is to bring this understanding to the EUTxO model and build upon it further.

Token Engineering is the art/science of applying an engineering approach to designing, validating and optimising a token economy (aka token design). This is typically used on (but not limited to) blockchains.

First, we start by understanding the system we want to create:

- Purpose of the system
- Who is involved
- What interactions take place between participants in the system
- How the system functions overall

After understanding this, we can design concepts and further refine them. A key part of this step is to transform the written/spoken information into mathematical relationships. These mathematical relationships can be further developed to formulate the behaviour and mechanisms of the system.

The behaviour and mechanisms (expressed mathematically) can be used to create a model, sometimes referred to as a digital twin. Simulations can be run to validate and optimise the model i.e. Is the system predicted to do what we want it to? and how can we develop it further, to produce even better results.

We can apply this engineering approach to design token economies that create systemic change for the better. Creating systems with effective governance built into their designs is another crucial part of token engineering. We want our token economies to be fair, able to make decisions, vote and come to consensus in a decentralised manner. Designing a system to do so is a challenge as there are trade offs and many different perspectives. Token engineering provides us with the tools and methodology to find the optimal solution.

By understanding these principles, we can design much better tokens that provide real value to everyone involved.
