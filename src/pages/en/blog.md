    - title: eUTXO and Token Engineering
      excerpt: Cardano's Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model extends Bitcoins underlying process UTXO accounting methodology. However the EUTXO is unfarmiliar to most drawing parallels with the REA (Resource-Event-Agent) accounting ontology we compare and contrast the Ethereum balance accounting model.
