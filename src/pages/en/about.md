A lot of teams are launching a token for their project; these all have tokenomics and other design decisions to be made for their ecosystem to function well. We need a better understanding of how to use tokens as a tool to create more advanced digital micro economies; not just as base cryptocurrencies or NFTs.

The current method is to make design decisions off 'feel' or just copy the best parts of what others have already done. This approach is hit-or-miss, it could very well work however, may not be efficient or effective.

Applying token engineering allows us to design the system based off robust and well structured engineering methods. We can leverage modelling and simulation tools to test and validate our design. Once we gain insight as to how our system operates and how different behaviours & mechanisms impact it then, we can fine-tune our design and optimise it. This is the proper approach to producing robust and well designed token-economies.

The practice of Token Engineering isn't well known on Cardano. Our intention is to start building a token engineering community in the EUTxO space so we can grow and learn together. This website is our hub where educational tutorials, code and articles can be found.
